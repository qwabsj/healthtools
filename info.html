        <h1>Prostate Biopsy for High-Risk or Positive Prediction of Prostate Cancer in Ghana</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>
            If you've been identified as high-risk or have a positive prediction for prostate cancer 
            through the prostate cancer screening app-Ghana, a prostate biopsy is a critical next step 
            in confirming the diagnosis and planning your treatment. Here's what you need to know 
            about the prostate biopsy process:
        </p>

        <h2>1. Where Can I Have a Prostate Biopsy in Ghana?</h2>
        <p>
            Prostate biopsies are commonly performed in major hospitals and medical centers across Ghana. 
            Some key facilities where you can get a prostate biopsy include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH), Accra:</strong> The largest teaching hospital in Ghana, offering advanced diagnostic services, including prostate biopsy.</li>
            <li><strong>Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), Kumasi:</strong> A leading hospital in the Ashanti Region, known for its comprehensive urology services.</li>
            <li><strong>37 Military Hospital, Accra:</strong> Offers specialized services for prostate cancer diagnosis, including prostate biopsy procedures.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Hospitals:</strong> Many private hospitals such as Medicare Hospital, Nyaho Medical Centre, and The Trust Hospital also provide prostate biopsy services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Consult with your urologist or healthcare provider for a referral and detailed guidance on scheduling a prostate biopsy.
        </p>

        <h2>2. What Should I Expect During a Prostate Biopsy?</h2>
        <h3>Pre-biopsy Preparation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consultation and Assessment:</strong> Your doctor will review your medical history, screening results, and discuss any medications you are taking.</li>
            <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> You may be prescribed antibiotics (e.g., Levofloxacin or Tavanic) to reduce the risk of infection.</li>
            <li><strong>Instructions:</strong> Avoid blood-thinning medications, like aspirin, a few weeks before the procedure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Biopsy Procedure:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Anesthesia:</strong> The biopsy is usually performed under local anesthesia. Sedation may be provided for relaxation.</li>
            <li><strong>Transrectal Approach:</strong> A transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy is the most common method, using a small ultrasound probe and biopsy needle to collect tissue samples.</li>
            <li><strong>Tissue Samples:</strong> Multiple small samples (usually 10–12) are taken from different parts of the prostate. The process typically takes 10–20 minutes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Post-biopsy Care:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Continue taking prescribed antibiotics (e.g., Levofloxacin/Tavanic).</li>
            <li>Drink plenty of water.</li>
            <li>Take prescribed pain-relief medications as needed.</li>
            <li class="contact-note">
                If you experience symptoms like blood in urine, stool, or semen; difficulty urinating; feverishness; dizziness; or other concerning side effects, contact your urologist immediately.
            </li>
            <li>Recovery may involve mild discomfort or spotting of blood in urine, stool, or semen, which typically resolves within a few days.</li>
        </ul>
